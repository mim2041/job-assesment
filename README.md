## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to build the core structure of the application.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling the application components. It provides a set of predefined classes to create a responsive design.
- **react-router-dom:** A routing library for React applications, used to manage client-side routing and navigation within the app.

### Authentication
- **Firebase Authentication:** A service by Google that provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to the app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, and popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook, and Twitter.

### State Management
- **React Hooks:** Built-in hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` are used for managing state and side effects in the application.

### Tools
- **Figma:** A web-based design tool used to create the initial design of the application. The design is then converted into a React.js application.

### Build Tools
- **Vite:** A build tool that provides a fast development environment and optimizes the build process for modern web applications. It replaces Create React App in this project.

### Additional Libraries
- **Swiper:** A modern mobile touch slider with hardware-accelerated transitions. It is used for the carousel/slider functionality in the application.
- **React Icons:** A collection of popular icons for React, used to add icons to the application.
- **SweetAlert2:** A beautiful, responsive, customizable, accessible (WAI-ARIA) replacement for JavaScript's popup boxes. It is used for displaying alert messages in the application.
